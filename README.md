# hive-mind

This is a project to create a basic Technical Wiki app for teams to share issues and solutions.

This project was created mainly as a learning experience to improve my skills.

It will consist of 2 applications in a monorepo structure:
1. `client-web` is a React app made using TypeScript and hosted on AWS S3.
2. `api` is planned to be a RESTful API hosted on AWS ApiGateway and AWS Lambda.
